# comparingevents
This is a repository that hosts my SETI event comparison script!

This script takes in two .dat files outputted by turboSETI and finds events (matching signals) between the two files, creating waterfall plots for all events and saving each plot as its own .png file. Two arguments are required to run this script: the first should be the path to the directory containing two .dat files (one per LWA station), and the second should be the path to the directory containing the two corresponding .h5 files.
